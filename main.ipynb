    "# Global Disaster Response Analysis (2018–2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "We analyze 50,000 global disaster records from 2018 to 2024 to examine how response characteristics relate to recovery duration. Using exploratory data analysis and a supervised regression model, we investigate associations between aid amount, response time, response efficiency, and recovery days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Understanding disaster recovery timelines is critical for effective disaster management and resource allocation. While many studies focus on disaster severity, fewer examine how response characteristics relate to recovery duration at a global scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "We use the Global Disaster Response Analysis dataset (2018–2024) from Kaggle. The dataset contains 50,000 records and 12 variables, including disaster type, country, severity index, casualties, economic loss, response time, aid amount, response efficiency score, and recovery days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "- How does recovery time vary across disaster types?\n",
    "- What is the relationship between aid amount, response metrics, and recovery duration?\n",
    "- Can recovery duration be predicted using available response and impact variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "We first perform exploratory data analysis to visualize relationships between key variables. We then frame recovery time prediction as a regression problem and apply a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model using standardized numeric features and encoded categorical variables.\n",
