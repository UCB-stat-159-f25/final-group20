In this project we analyze the Global Disaster Response Analysis dataset from Kaggle to understand and predict how long countries take to recover from disasters, motivated by the importance of improving disaster response planning and aid allocation. The dataset is 4.39 MB and can be downloaded via Kaggle as a ZIP file or using kagglehub, and is small enough to be included in the repository. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis using visualizations such as scatterplots of response time versus aid amount, country-level severity summaries, and geographic maps, followed by machine learning methods to predict recovery time based on disaster characteristics and aid received. To run the analysis, users should install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt, download the dataset, and execute the provided notebooks or scripts in order. Basic testing and reproducibility are supported through structured notebooks and automated scripts to ensure consistent results.

## Tests
Run `pytest` from the project root to execute unit tests.
